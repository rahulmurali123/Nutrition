          <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Nutrition refers to the process of obtaining and consuming food to provide the body with the necessary nutrients for growth, maintenance, and overall health. Proper nutrition is essential for human well-being, as it plays a vital role in various bodily functions, including energy production, immune system support, and the maintenance of healthy tissues and organs.Balanced nutrition involves consuming a variety of foods from all food groups in appropriate proportions to meet your body's nutritional needs. A healthy diet can help prevent various health conditions, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.

              It's important to note that individual nutritional needs can vary based on factors such as age, gender, activity level, and underlying health conditions. Consulting with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional can provide personalized guidance on nutrition and dietary choices.</p>

        <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis">Proteins</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Proteins are essential macronutrients that play numerous critical roles in the human body. They are composed of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids that can combine in various ways to form a vast array of proteins.  Proteins are integral to the structure of cells, tissues, and organs in the body. They are responsible for the formation of muscle tissue, skin, hair, nails, and various structural elements.While carbohydrates and fats are the primary sources of energy, proteins can also be used for energy when carbohydrate and fat stores are insufficient. However, this is not their primary role. Protein can be found in a variety of foods, including animal sources such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Plant-based sources of protein include legumes (e.g., beans and lentils), tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and some grains (e.g., quinoa).</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Carbohydrates are one of the three main macronutrients, along with proteins and fats, and they are a crucial source of energy for the human body. Carbohydrates consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms and come in various forms, including sugars, starches, and fibers. They can be found in a wide range of foods, including grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and dairy products.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. When consumed, they are broken down into glucose (a type of sugar) in the digestive system and then transported to cells to provide energy for various bodily functions, including muscle contraction, brain function, and overall metabolism.</p>

        <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis">Vitamins</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Vitamins are essential organic compounds that the human body requires in small amounts to maintain normal physiological functions, growth, and overall health. They play various roles in the body's metabolism, serving as coenzymes, antioxidants, and regulators of numerous biochemical reactions.  These vitamins are soluble in dietary fats and are stored in the body's fatty tissues. The fat-soluble vitamins include: Vitamin A,Vitamin D, Vitamin E,Vitamin K. Vitamin deficiency can lead to various health problems and conditions, so it's crucial to obtain an adequate supply through a balanced diet. While most people can get their daily vitamin needs from food, some individuals may require supplements under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially if they have specific dietary restrictions, malabsorption issues, or certain medical conditions.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Minerals are inorganic nutrients that are essential for various physiological functions in the human body. Unlike vitamins, which are organic compounds, minerals are naturally occurring elements and chemical compounds. Calcium: Essential for strong bones and teeth, blood clotting, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods are good sources.

            Phosphorus: Works in conjunction with calcium for bone health, and it is also involved in energy metabolism. Found in meat, dairy products, and nuts.
            
            Magnesium: Important for muscle and nerve function, bone health, and maintaining normal blood pressure. Sources include nuts, seeds, whole grains, and leafy greens.Trace Minerals:

            Iron: Necessary for the formation of red blood cells and oxygen transport in the body. Good sources include red meat, poultry, fish, and fortified cereals. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia.
            
            Zinc: Important for immune function, wound healing, and DNA synthesis. Found in foods like meat, nuts, seeds, and dairy products.
            
            Copper: Plays a role in the formation of red blood cells, collagen production, and nerve function. It is present in organ meats, seafood, nuts, and beans.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Fats, also known as lipids, are an essential macronutrient that plays various critical roles in the human body. While often associated with negative health outcomes, fats are necessary for overall health and are an important part of a balanced diet.Energy Source: Fats are a concentrated source of energy, providing more than twice the calories per gram compared to carbohydrates and proteins. They serve as a vital source of long-term energy storage in the body.
            Fatty Acids: Fats are composed of molecules called fatty acids. There are different types of fatty acids, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, each with distinct effects on health. Essential Fatty Acids: Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are essential because the body cannot synthesize them. They play crucial roles in brain function, inflammation control, and cell membrane structure.
            Fat-Soluble Vitamins: Fats are necessary for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Consuming fats along with foods rich in these vitamins helps the body absorb and utilize them effectively.</p>
